"""
Create a network and start sshd(8) on each host.

While something like rshd(8) would be lighter and faster,
(and perfectly adequate on an in-machine network)
the advantage of running sshd is that scripts can work
unchanged on mininet and hardware.

In addition to providing ssh access to hosts, this example
demonstrates:

- creating a convenience function to construct networks
- connecting the host network to the root namespace
- running server processes (sshd in this case) on hosts
