"""
This example creates a multi-controller network from semi-scratch by
using the net.add*() API and manually starting the switches and controllers.

This is the "mid-level" API, which is an alternative to the "high-level"
Topo() API which supports parametrized topology classes.

Note that one could also create a custom switch class and pass it into
the Mininet() constructor.
