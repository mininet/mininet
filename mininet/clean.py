Mininet Cleanup
author: Bob Lantz (rlantz@cs.stanford.edu)

Unfortunately, Mininet and OpenFlow (and the Linux kernel)
don't always clean up properly after themselves. Until they do
(or until cleanup functionality is integrated into the Python
code), this script may be used to get rid of unwanted garbage.
It may also get rid of 'false positives', but hopefully
nothing irreplaceable!
