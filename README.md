Mininet: Rapid Prototyping for Software Defined Networks
========================================================
*The best way to emulate almost any network on your laptop!*

Mininet 2.3.1b1

[![Build Status][1]](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/actions)


### What is Mininet?

Mininet emulates a complete network of hosts, links, and switches
on a single machine.  To create a sample two-host, one-switch network,
just run:

  `sudo mn`

Mininet is useful for interactive development, testing, and demos,
especially those using OpenFlow and SDN.  OpenFlow-based network
controllers prototyped in Mininet can usually be transferred to
hardware with minimal changes for full line-rate execution.

### How does it work?

Mininet creates virtual networks using process-based virtualization
and network namespaces - features that are available in recent Linux
kernels.  In Mininet, hosts are emulated as `bash` processes running in
a network namespace, so any code that would normally run on a Linux
server (like a web server or client program) should run just fine
within a Mininet "Host".  The Mininet "Host" will have its own private
network interface and can only see its own processes.  Switches in
Mininet are software-based switches like Open vSwitch or the OpenFlow
reference switch.  Links are virtual ethernet pairs, which live in the
Linux kernel and connect our emulated switches to emulated hosts
(processes).

### Features

Mininet includes:

* A command-line launcher (`mn`) to instantiate networks.

* A handy Python API for creating networks of varying sizes and
  topologies.

* Examples (in the `examples/` directory) to help you get started.

* Full API documentation via Python `help()` docstrings, as well as
  the ability to generate PDF/HTML documentation with `make doc`.

* Parametrized topologies (`Topo` subclasses) using the Mininet
  object.  For example, a tree network may be created with the
  command:

  `mn --topo tree,depth=2,fanout=3`

* A command-line interface (`CLI` class) which provides useful
  diagnostic commands (like `iperf` and `ping`), as well as the
  ability to run a command to a node. For example,

  `mininet> h11 ifconfig -a`

  tells host h11 to run the command `ifconfig -a`

* A "cleanup" command to get rid of junk (interfaces, processes, files
  in /tmp, etc.) which might be left around by Mininet or Linux. Try
  this if things stop working!

  `mn -c`

### Python 3 Support

- Mininet 2.3.1b1 supports Python 3 and Python 2!

- You can install both the Python 3 and Python 2 versions of
Mininet side by side, but the most recent installation will
determine which Python version is used by default by `mn`.

- You can run `mn` directly with Python 2 or Python 3,
  as long as the appropriate version of Mininet is installed,
  e.g.

      $ sudo python2 `which mn`

- More information regarding Python 3 and Python 2 support
  may be found in the release notes on http://docs.mininet.org.

### Other Enhancements and Information

- Support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (and 18.04)

- More reliable testing and CI via github actions

- Minor bug fixes (2.3.1)

- Additional information about this release and previous releases
  may be found in the release notes on http://docs.mininet.org.

### Installation

See `INSTALL` for installation instructions and details.

### Documentation

In addition to the API documentation (`make doc`), much useful
information, including a Mininet walkthrough and an introduction
to the Python API, is available on the
[Mininet Web Site](http://mininet.org).
There is also a wiki which you are encouraged to read and to
contribute to, particularly the Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQ) at http://faq.mininet.org.

### Support

Mininet is community-supported. We encourage you to join the
Mininet mailing list, `mininet-discuss` at:
